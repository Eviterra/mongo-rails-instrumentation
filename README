Mongo Rails 3 Instrumentation
=============================

Records how long your rails app spends in Mongo, and outputs it to the log, i.e.:

    Completed 200 OK in 1535ms (Views: 623.3ms | Mongo: 848.2ms)

To use, just add the gem to your Gemfile and restart your app:

    gem 'mongo-rails-instrumentation', '~>0.2'

It's been tested with rails 3.0, and should work with rails 3.1 too.

This gem's home is on github at https://github.com/tomafro/mongo-rails-instrumentation, so please add comments, suggestions and improvements there. All code is released under the MIT License.
